# 🔍 Image Segmentation Using U-Net

## 📝 Project Statement

This project focuses on implementing a U-Net-based deep learning model to perform pixel-wise image segmentation. The goal is to accurately segment objects or regions of interest from input images using corresponding ground truth masks.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation.
- Train the model on a dataset with image-mask pairs.
- Evaluate model performance using segmentation metrics (IoU, Dice, etc.).
- Visualize predictions to validate segmentation quality.
- Optionally, deploy the model for inference on new data.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of:

- **Images**: Input images for segmentation (e.g., medical scans, natural scenes).
- **Masks**: Binary or multi-class segmentation masks where each pixel represents a class label.

**Directory Structure:**
