# Python Basics: Variables and Data Types

## What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language.  
It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and released in **1991**.

## What Can Python Do?
- Create web applications  
- Read and modify files  
- Handle big data and perform complex mathematics  
- Build AI and ML applications  
- Automate tasks and scripting

---

## Why Python?
- Supports different platforms  
- Has a simple syntax (similar to English)  
- Powerful AI and ML Libraries  
- Integrates with other programming languages

# Concepts

## Variables
A **variable** in programming is like a container that holds data.  
It allows you to store and manipulate values in your code.

### Casting
Casting means assigning a specific data type to a variable.

```python
x = str(5)    # x is '5'
y = int(5)    # y is 5
z = float(5)  # z is 5.0
```

## Data Types
Data types help define what kind of data a variable stores.

### 1. String (`str`)
Stores text enclosed in single or double quotes.

```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = 'Hello'
```

### 2. Integer (`int`)
Stores whole numbers (positive or negative).

```python
age = 25
year = 2025
```

### 3. Float (`float`)
Stores decimal numbers.

```python
price = 19.99
pi = 3.14159
```

### 4. Boolean (`bool`)
Stores True or False values.

```python
is_active = True
is_logged_in = False
```

## Example

```python
name = "John"         # string
age = 30              # integer
height = 5.9          # float
is_student = True     # boolean

print(name, age, height, is_student)
```

## Summary
- Variables store values in memory.
- Python supports different data types like strings, integers, floats, and booleans.
- Casting can be used to explicitly set a data type.
