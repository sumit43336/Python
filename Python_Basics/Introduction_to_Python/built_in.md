# Python Built-in Data Structures

Python provides several built-in data structures that help in organizing and managing data efficiently. These include **Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets**. Understanding these structures is crucial for writing efficient Python programs.

## **1. Lists**
A **list** is an ordered, mutable collection that allows duplicate elements. Lists can store elements of different data types, including other lists.

### **Key Properties**
- Ordered (elements maintain their position)
- Mutable (can be changed after creation)
- Allows duplicate values
- Supports indexing and slicing

### **Common Operations**
- Adding elements (appending, inserting)
- Removing elements (deleting by value, position)
- Concatenation and repetition
- List comprehensions for generating lists efficiently
- Sorting and reversing elements

---

## **2. Tuples**
A **tuple** is an ordered, immutable collection that allows duplicate values. Tuples are useful for storing fixed sets of values.

### **Key Properties**
- Ordered (maintains element order)
- Immutable (cannot be modified after creation)
- Allows duplicate values
- Can be used as dictionary keys

### **Common Operations**
- Accessing elements using indexing
- Concatenation and repetition
- Tuple unpacking (assigning values to multiple variables at once)
- Nesting tuples within other data structures

---

## **3. Dictionaries**
A **dictionary** is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and values are accessed using these keys.

### **Key Properties**
- Unordered (elements have no fixed position)
- Mutable (can modify values and add new key-value pairs)
- Keys must be unique and immutable
- Fast lookup compared to lists and tuples

### **Common Operations**
- Accessing values using keys
- Modifying, adding, and deleting key-value pairs
- Retrieving keys, values, and key-value pairs
- Using dictionary comprehensions for efficient data mapping
- Merging dictionaries

---

## **4. Sets**
A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are used for mathematical operations like unions and intersections.

### **Key Properties**
- Unordered (elements do not maintain any specific order)
- Mutable (elements can be added or removed, but the set itself is mutable)
- No duplicate values
- Supports set operations like union, intersection, and difference

### **Common Operations**
- Adding and removing elements
- Checking membership (fast lookup)
- Performing set operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference)
- Removing duplicates from lists
